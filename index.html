                        <h4>What Did I Learn?</h4>
                        <p>In Unit 1, I was introduced to the concept of self-regulated learning through the DAACS assessment. As a Navy veteran transitioning to civilian life and a new career as a data analyst, this assessment provided valuable insights into my learning strengths and areas for improvement. I discovered that while I excel at creating a distraction-free study environment, I face challenges with time management, help-seeking, and test anxiety.</p>
                        <p>My DAACS report highlighted how my military background influenced my approach to learning. After 23 years in the Navy as an Aviation Machinists Mate, I developed a habit of operating under pressure and prioritizing others' needs over my own. This assessment helped me understand that what worked in a high-tempo military environment might not be the most effective approach for academic success.</p>
                        <p>The mindset discussion revealed that I possess a strong growth mindset in many areas, particularly in my professional capabilities, but also showed how my background as a non-native English speaker sometimes affects my confidence in academic settings.</p>

                    <div class="reflection-section">
                        <h4>How Will I Use This Moving Forward?</h4>
                        <p>Moving forward, I plan to leverage the DAACS assessment results as a roadmap for improving my academic strategies. Now that I understand my strengths and weaknesses, I can take specific actions to address areas needing development:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For help-seeking, I'll practice overcoming my reluctance to ask questions by reminding myself that seeking assistance isn't a burden but can actually benefit both myself and others. I'll use the resources UMGC provides, such as tutoring services and the Effective Writing Center.</li>
                            <li>For time management, I'll implement structured planning using the techniques suggested in the DAACS resources, including creating consistent study schedules and prioritizing assignments based on importance and deadline.</li>
                            <li>For test anxiety, I'll utilize relaxation techniques before and during high-stress situations and focus on consistent preparation rather than last-minute cramming.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="key-takeaway">
                        <h5 class="key-takeaway-title">Key Takeaways</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self-awareness is the foundation of personal growth. The DAACS assessment provided objective feedback that helped me see patterns in my learning behaviors that I might not have recognized on my own.</li>
                            <li>My background in the Navy gave me valuable skills like problem-solving and persistence, but also created habits that may need adjustment in an academic environment.</li>
                            <li>As I mentioned in my introduction post, my approach to troubleshooting aircraft engines—breaking down complex problems into manageable parts—can be applied to my academic journey. Just as I would "take a step back, assess the situation, and figure out how everything was supposed to come together" when faced with mechanical issues, I can apply this same methodical approach to overcoming learning challenges.</li>
                            <li>The path from military service to data science represents not just a career change but an opportunity to combine my technical expertise with new academic knowledge in ways that align with my natural curiosity and problem-solving abilities.</li>
                            <li>I recognize that this self-assessment is not just about identifying weaknesses but about building on my existing strengths to create a solid foundation for success at UMGC and in my data science career.</li>

                        <h4>Goals & Motivations Assignment</h4>
                        <p>This assignment helped me articulate both my short-term academic goals and long-term career aspirations. I learned the importance of setting SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and connecting them to my intrinsic motivations.</p>
                        <p>I identified that my primary motivation for pursuing education is to enhance my professional skills and create more opportunities for career advancement. Understanding my "why" has helped me stay focused during challenging times.</p>

                        <h4>What are Your Big Rocks? Discussion</h4>
                        <p>This discussion introduced the concept of "big rocks" – the most important priorities in my life that should be scheduled first. I identified my education, family relationships, health, and career development as my big rocks.</p>
                        <p>I learned that effective time management isn't about finding more time but making deliberate choices about how to use the time I have.</p>

                        <p>In this assignment, I created a comprehensive weekly schedule that incorporated my big rocks while also accounting for regular responsibilities and personal needs. I learned techniques for prioritizing tasks, avoiding procrastination, and maintaining work-life balance.</p>

                        <p>Scheduling my priorities rather than prioritizing what's already on my schedule has been a game-changer. By blocking time for my most important goals first and protecting that time, I've become more productive and focused while reducing stress and last-minute rushes.</p>

                        <p>This assignment prompted me to identify and map out my personal success network – the people and resources who can support me throughout my academic journey. I learned that having a strong support system is crucial for overcoming challenges and achieving goals.</p>
                        <p>I identified mentors, peers, family members, and institutional resources that form my success network, and I developed strategies for strengthening these connections.</p>
